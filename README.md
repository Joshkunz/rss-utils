A bunch of utilities for turning things into RSS feeds. All are hosted, feel free to use them.

Turn your tumblr dashboard into an RSS feed, because apparently the tumblr
team decided this was a bad idea.

A copy of this is running on my website at [rss.joshkunz.com]("http://rss.joshkunz.com/tumblr/dashboard")

*Note* This there is a security aspect to this script. If you make an rss feed
of your dashboard *it will become visible to everyone* for most people this is not
a major issue but if you don't want others to be able to read the blogs you follow.
I would reccomend, taking a pass.
