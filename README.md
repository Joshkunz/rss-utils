tumblr2RSS
==========

Turns your tumblr dashboard into an RSS feed.

A copy of this is running on my website at 
[tumblr2rss.obstack.net](http://tumblr2rss.obstack.net)
just follow the steps and you will get a link like 
`http://tumblr2rss.obstack.net/tumblr/dashboard/<user-name>.rss`
which can be used in your feed reader of choice.

*Note* This there is a security aspect to this script. If you make an rss feed
of your dashboard *it will become visible to everyone* for most people this is not
a major issue but if you don't want others to be able to read the blogs you follow.
I would recommend, taking a pass.
