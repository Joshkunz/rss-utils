RSS Utils
==========
A bunch of utilities for turning things into RSS feeds. All are hosted, feel free to use them.

tumblr2RSS
-----------

Turn your tumblr dashboard into an RSS feed, because apparently the tumblr
team decided this was a bad idea.

A copy of this is running on my website at [rss.joshkunz.com](http://rss.joshkunz.com/tumblr/dashboard)
just follow the steps and you will get a link like `rss.joshkunz.com/tumblr/dashboard/<user-name>.rss`
which can be used in your feed reader of choice.

*Note* This there is a security aspect to this script. If you make an rss feed
of your dashboard *it will become visible to everyone* for most people this is not
a major issue but if you don't want others to be able to read the blogs you follow.
I would reccomend, taking a pass.

Gawker filters
----------------

In my personal opinion gawker blogs tend to clog up my rss feed so I don't really subscribe to them.
However I do like to read some of their posts, thus gawker top3. just use the format: 
`rss.joshkunz.com/gawker/top3/<gawker-site>` to get the top 3 posts for that site. so `/gawker/top3/gizmodo` will 
give you the top 3 most viewed recent posts from gizmodo.
